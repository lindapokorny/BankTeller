/*Write a command line tool for a Bank that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data for customers and their bank accounts.

This program should have the following functionality:

Require that a user (Bank Teller) sign-in with a pre-determined Username and Password
Allow a user to list all of the current customers for your bank
Allow a user to add new customers
Allow a user to list all of the bank accounts for each user of the bank

Allow a user to add new bank accounts
Allow a user to view and update the account balances for every customer (deposit or withdraw an amount of money)
Allow a user to close an entire account


Allow a user to delete a customer, and all their data
Allow a user to sign out of the program
Note:

Upon sign-in, the system should already have 5 customers in the data structure
Each customer should have at least 1 (one) account
Each account should have a current balance
When the Bank Teller signs out, and signs back in - the account data should return to their pre-set values
